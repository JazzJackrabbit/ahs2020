                    <b>Biography:</b> Stelarc’s projects and performances explore alternate anatomies. His first
                    projects in 1968 were helmets that split binocular vision. His early actions from 1970 involved
                    amplifying body signals and sounds as control signals for real-time interaction. Between 1973-1975
                    he made 3 films of the inside of his body. Between 1976-1988 he realised 27
                    body suspensions with insertions into his skin, in different positions, in remote locations and in
                    varying situations. In 1980 the Third Hand, an EMG controlled mechanism, with pinch, grasp and wrist
                    rotation, was engineered. For the Fifth Australian Sculpture Triennial in 1993 he designed a
                    sculpture for the inside of his stomach. In 1997 in Hamburg City, Exoskeleton, a 6-legged walking
                    robot was engineered. Fractal Flesh, Ping Body and Parasite were internet performances that explored
                    remote and involuntary choreography via a muscle stimulation system. He has surgically constructed
                    and cell grown an ear on his arm in 2006. The intent is still to electronically augment and internet
                    enable it. In 2017 with
                    Propel, he was attached to the end of an industrial robot arm so that his position/orientation,
                    trajectory and velocity could be precisely programmed. With the Re-Wired / Re-Mixed performance,
                    2018, for five days, six hours a day in Perth,
                    he could only see with the eyes of someone in London, only hear with the ears of someone in NY,
                    whilst anyone, anywhere could choreograph his exoskeleton arm. StickMan is an interactive
                    installation and performance where the body was actuated by a minimal but full-body exoskeleton. In
                    1996 he was made an Honorary Professor of Art and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh
                    and in 2002 was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Monash University, Melbourne. In 2010 he
                    was awarded the Ars Electronica Hybrid Arts Prize. In 2015 he received the Australia Council’s
                    Emerging and Experimental Arts Award. In 2016 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Ionian
                    University, Corfu.
                    Between 2013 – 2018 Stelarc was a Distinguished Research Fellow, School of Media, Creative Arts and
                    Social Inquiry (MCASI), Curtin University, Perth. His artwork is represented by Scott Livesey
                    Galleries, Melbourne.

                    <b>Biography:</b> Kasper Hornbæk is a Professor in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen.
                    He received his PhD from the
                    University of Copenhagen in 2002. Hornbæk’s work has contributed to HCI in two important ways.
                    First, he and his
                    coauthors have created new models of usability and user experience. They have shown that we can
                    measure how computer
                    tools extend our bodies; that different aspects of usability are orthogonal (and therefore should be
                    measured
                    independently); and that meaning is an overlooked component of user experience. Second, Hornbæk and
                    his collaborators
                    have sought to develop fundamental concepts and methods in the HCI field. They have discussed the
                    field-defining concept
                    of interaction, analysed what it means that a user interface is subtle, and outlined the key types
                    of problems addressed
                    in HCI. Currently, Hornbæk works on body-based user interfaces and human-computer integration.

                    <b>Biography:</b> Enkelejda Kasneci is a Full Professor of Computer Science at the University of
                    Tübingen, Germany, where she leads the
                    Human-Computer Interaction Group. As a BOSCH-scholar, she received her M.Sc. degree in Computer
                    Science from the
                    University of Stuttgart in 2007. In 2013, she received her PhD in Computer Science from the
                    University of Tübingen. For
                    her PhD research, she was awarded the research prize of the Federation Südwestmetall in 2014. From
                    2013 to 2015, she was
                    a Margarete-von-Wrangell Fellow. Her main research interests are applied machine learning,
                    eye-tracking technology and
                    applications. She serves as a reviewer and PC member for several journals and major conferences. In
                    2016, she founded
                    LeadersLikeHer, the world’s first open career network for women from industrial, research and public
                    organizations.
