about: |
  The Augmented Humans (AH) International Conference will be held in Kaiserslautern, Germany, on March 16-18, 2020, focusing on physical, cognitive, and perceptual augmenting humans through digital technologies. The plural – humans – emphasizes the move towards technologies that enhance human capabilities beyond the individual and will have the potential for impact on societal scale.
  The idea of augmenting the human intellect has a long tradition, as this term was coined by Douglas Engelbart in 1962 [1], but it becomes now realistic to create usable technologies that augment and even amplify the human body and mind.
  Many of the people involved in this conference have shaped as conference and program chairs and authors the field and the previous augment human conference. As in the augmented human conference in previous years, the conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library (acceptance pending) as a volume in its International Conference Proceedings Series with ISBN.
