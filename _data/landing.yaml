about: |
  After 10 years of augmented human conferences there was disagreement on how to move the conference forward. As this dispute was not resolved, this resulted in two AH2020 conferences to be held in 2020. One (the conference described on this website, organized by this <a href="/committee#steering">steering committee</a>) will be held in Kaiserslautern, Germany. The other one (please see this <a href="https://www.augmented-human.com">website</a>) will be held in Winnipeg, Canada.
  The Augmented Humans (AH) International Conference will be held in Kaiserslautern, Germany, on March 16-18, 2020, focusing on physical, cognitive, and perceptual augmentation of humans through digital technologies. The plural – humans – emphasizes the move towards technologies that enhance human capabilities beyond the individual and will have the potential for impact on societal scale.
  The idea of augmenting the human intellect has a long tradition, the term was coined by Douglas Engelbart in 1962 [1]. Today, many of the technologies envisioned by Engelbart and other are commonplace, and looking towards the future, many technologies which amplify the human body and mind far beyond the original vision are within reach.
  Many of the people involved in this conference have shaped the conference and the field in their roles as program chairs, steering committee or authors at previous augment human conferences. As in the augmented human conference in previous years, the conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library (acceptance pending) as a volume in its International Conference Proceedings Series with ISBN.
