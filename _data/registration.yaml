  Since the TU Kaiserslautern takes full financial responsibility instead of ACM, unfortunately no ACM member discount is available.

  <b>Visa letter:</b>
  Should you require an invitation letter for an entry visa, please directly contact the general chair (<a href="mailto:bo.zhou@dfki.de">bo.zhou@dfki.de</a>) with your full name and passport number. The registration is refundable under the following circumstances: flight / travel cancellation, entry visa rejection, and other non-foreseeable accidents. 
  A refund needs to be requested to the general chairs before 15th March 2020. The refund may be partial if certain costs for the participant have already been booked or occurred. Details will be explicitly provided for such cases.
