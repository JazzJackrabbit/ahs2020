  <b>Late Registration:</b>
  The physical participation fees will be increased by 10% for both the student and non-student rates from March 9th at 9am CET as late-registration premium.
  On-site registration is also possible at the same late-registration rate.
  The virtual participation fees will not be increased.
  
  Since the TU Kaiserslautern takes full financial responsibility instead of ACM, unfortunately no ACM member discount is available.
  
  <b>Switch from Physical to Virtual Participation:</b>
  If you have already registered for any of the physical participation ticket, but wants to change to a virtual participation, we will return you the difference by issuing a refund of the physical ticket and purchase a new virtual ticket. Please contact Bo Zhou <a href="mailto:bo.zhou@dfki.de">bo.zhou@dfki.de</a> for the procedure details. Before Midnight March 8th CET, this process will be completely free; afterwards any incurred fee need to be charged (up to 5€).

  <b>Visa letter:</b>
  Should you require an invitation letter for an entry visa, please directly contact the general chair (<a href="mailto:bo.zhou@dfki.de">bo.zhou@dfki.de</a>) with your full name and passport number. The registration is refundable under the following circumstances: flight / travel cancellation, entry visa rejection, and other non-foreseeable accidents. 
  A refund needs to be requested to the general chairs before 15th March 2020. The refund may be partial if certain costs for the participant have already been booked or occurred. Details will be explicitly provided for such cases.
