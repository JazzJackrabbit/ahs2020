  Stelarc 

  Title: "Contemporary Chimeras: Creepy, Uncanny and Contestable Bodies"

  Biography: Stelarc’s projects and performances explore alternate anatomies. His first projects in 1968 were helmets that split binocular vision. His early actions from 1970 involved amplifying body signals and sounds as control signals for real-time interaction. Between 1973-1975 he made 3 films of the inside of his body. Between 1976-1988 he realised 27 body suspensions with insertions into his skin, in different positions, in remote locations and in varying situations. In 1980 the Third Hand, an EMG controlled mechanism, with  pinch, grasp and wrist rotation, was engineered. For the Fifth Australian Sculpture Triennial in 1993 he designed a sculpture for the inside of his stomach. In 1997 in Hamburg City, Exoskeleton, a 6-legged walking robot was engineered. Fractal Flesh, Ping Body and Parasite were internet performances that explored remote and involuntary choreography via a muscle stimulation system. He has surgically constructed and cell grown an ear on his arm in 2006. The intent is still to electronically augment and internet enable it. In 2017 with Propel, he was attached to the end of an industrial robot arm so that his position/orientation, trajectory and velocity could be precisely programmed. With the Re-Wired / Re-Mixed performance, 2018, for five days, six hours a day in Perth, he could only see with the eyes of someone in London, only hear with the ears of someone in NY, whilst anyone, anywhere could choreograph his exoskeleton arm. StickMan is an interactive installation and performance where the body was actuated by a minimal but full-body exoskeleton. In 1996 he was made an Honorary Professor of Art and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh and in 2002 was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Monash University, Melbourne. In 2010 he was awarded the Ars Electronica Hybrid Arts Prize. In 2015 he received the Australia Council’s Emerging and Experimental Arts Award. In 2016 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Ionian University, Corfu. Between 2013 – 2018 Stelarc was a Distinguished Research Fellow, School of Media, Creative Arts and Social Inquiry (MCASI), Curtin University, Perth. His artwork is represented by Scott Livesey Galleries, Melbourne.


  Kasper Hornbæk

  Title: TBA

  Biography: Kasper Hornbæk is a Professor in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. He received his PhD from the University of Copenhagen in 2002. Hornbæk’s work has contributed to HCI in two important ways. First, he and his coauthors have created new models of usability and user experience. They have shown that we can measure how computer tools extend our bodies; that different aspects of usability are orthogonal (and therefore should be measured independently); and that meaning is an overlooked component of user experience. Second, Hornbæk and his collaborators have sought to develop fundamental concepts and methods in the HCI field. They have discussed the field-defining concept of interaction, analysed what it means that a user interface is subtle, and outlined the key types of problems addressed in HCI. Currently, Hornbæk works on body-based user interfaces and human-computer integration.


  Enkelejda Kasneci

  Title: "It’s in Your Eyes – How Eye Tracking will Shape our Future"

  Enkelejda Kasneci is a Full Professor of Computer Science at the University of Tübingen, Germany, where she leads the Human-Computer Interaction Group. As a BOSCH-scholar, she received her M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the University of Stuttgart in 2007. In 2013, she received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Tübingen. For her PhD research, she was awarded the research prize of the Federation Südwestmetall in 2014. From 2013 to 2015, she was a Margarete-von-Wrangell Fellow. Her main research interests are applied machine learning, eye-tracking technology and applications. She serves as a reviewer and PC member for several journals and major conferences. In 2016, she founded LeadersLikeHer, the world’s first open career network for women from industrial, research and public organizations.
